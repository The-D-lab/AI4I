    "  \n",
    "<b>'Building a radiomics classifier that distinguishes between benign and malignant lesions will certainly improve clinical handling of suspicious lesions, and minimize the need for invasive procedures' - the aim of all the radiomics researchers.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, you will use a privately collected contrast enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) of 1058 patients at Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC). You will build a classifier to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions. Such a model will reduce the necessity for invasive tissue biopsies. If you find this task, or parts of it, too hard, you can \"cheat\" by looking at the beginners notebook, as most tasks are very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> this dataset is private and allowed to be used only for the purpose of this course! Nevertheless, for this notebook, we provide you with the features extracted from the data as an invert transformation is not possible. If you want to extract the features yourself, you will receive the dedicated instructions at the practical. In this case, please make sure you delete imaging data after the workshop. For this, you can use a precision-medicine-toolbox: https://github.com/primakov/precision-medicine-toolbox. For the hints, you can have a look at the beginners notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K-sg8g2Po6Czq5utFS2F6CtetXcrwpIt?usp=sharing.\n",

    "<b>Brief description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mammography is the standard imaging tool for breast-cancer screening, but is prone to false positives and lowered sensitivity in high-density breasts. Contrast enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) depicts breast lesions with more accuracy and with higher sensitivity than regular mammograms. This technique uses an iodine contrast agent in addition to a high energy and low energy mammogram to cancel out background noise and enhance the tumor. The advantage of CESM compared to regular mammography is that breast density does not affect image quality, and it boasts a sensitivity of 93-100%, compared to 75-85% of mammography on regular breasts, and lower than 50% in dense breasts.   \n",

    "A typical contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) examination (only right mediolateral oblique view shown), consisting of a low-energy (a), high-energy (b) and recombined (c) image. A suspicious lesion is seen on the low-energy image, showing enhancement on the recombined image (white arrows). Histopathology showed invasive ductal carcinoma. The high-energy image is not for diagnostic purposes but is used for construction of the recombined image (Lalji, U.C., Jeukens, C.R.L.P.N., Houben, I. et al. Evaluation of low-energy contrast-enhanced spectral mammography images by comparing them to full-field digital mammography using EUREF image quality criteria. Eur Radiol 25, 2813â€“2820 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-015-3695-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Problem</b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Though CESM improves the detection of breast lesions, there is still a challenge in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions, as the specificity of CESM is estimated to be 70%. This stands to improve using machine learning (ML) algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Notebook structure</b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python script will take you through the following steps:  \n",
    " - Installing packages and importing libraries,\n",
    " - Reading the data and assigning the outcomes,\n",
    " - Removing redundant features and selecting predictive features,\n",
    " - Creating the classification models.\n",
    "If you still have time, go back and try balancing your data, and fine-tune your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interactive Python notebook. To run it, you don't need to install anything on your PC since the script is executed in the cloud. On the left tab, you can see the 'Files' folder, that contains the data. Results of the script execution will be saved in this folder.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The information about the curated imaging dataset will be distributed separately. To open DICOM files, you can use 3D Slicer (https://www.slicer.org/), RadiAnt viewer (https://www.radiantviewer.com/), or MicroDicom viewer (https://www.microdicom.com/downloads.html). As feature extraction process takes time, we prepared the Excel tables with the pre-extracted features to work with. All the data will be pulled from the shared Google Drive to the temporary environment of this notebook. Further it is explained how to get these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that all the files you pull or upload to this notebook, as well as the files, produced while executing the script, are automatically deleted as soon as you end the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the needed Python packages have to be uploaded. Some of them are not installed in the environment of this notebook, so the installation is needed with '!pip install <i>name-of-the-package</i>' command. We recommend you get acquainted with getting documentation and help on these packages. For example, google 'python sklearn' and you will get to the documentation quickly. Importing libraries is a necessary step with most progamming languages, not only Python."
