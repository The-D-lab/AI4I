    "# Radiomics for beginners\n",
    "  \n",
    "<b>'Data curation is the most laborious and boring step of the radiomics workflow' - anyone who has ever worked with radiomics</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, you will use an open-source dataset of 422 NSCLC cancer patients named NSCLC Radiomics in TCIA https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NSCLC-Radiomics, also known as MAASTRO-Lung-1 (Aerts, H. J. W. L., Wee, L., Rios Velazquez, E., Leijenaar, R. T. H., Parmar, C., Grossmann, P., Carvalho, S., Bussink, J., Monshouwer, R., Haibe-Kains, B., Rietveld, D., Hoebers, F., Rietbergen, M. M., Leemans, C. R., Dekker, A., Quackenbush, J., Gillies, R. J., Lambin, P. (2019). Data From NSCLC-Radiomics [Data set]. The Cancer Imaging Archive. https://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.PF0M9REI), Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/). You will build a classifier to differentiate contast-enhanced from non-contrast-enhanced lung CT scans using radiomic features extracted from the gross tumor volume (GTV). Incredibly, these data were originally (and still are) used without this differentiation, leading to poor model performance for clinical outcomes. Such classifying models can easily help you curate your dataset or add a new label to your list of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Brief description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Iodinated contrast agents can be used for obtaining a CT image depending on the clinical question that one wants to address. The purpose of such agents can be to enhance the contrast resolution between a lesion/ischemic or occluded region and the normally perfused surrounding tissues.\n",
    "Sometimes contrast-enhanced CT is desireable, though the patient has an absolute contra-indication for contrast, such as:\n",
    "* allergy to intravenous contrast media,\n",
    "* pregnancy (particularly in the first trimester),\n",
    "* severe renal impairment,\n",
    "* hyperthyroidism/goitre (IV contrast might induce thyrotoxic crisis), etc.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The task of assessing whether an image is contrast-enhanced is <b>fairly easy in early/late arterial phases</b> (major arteries appear as hyperdense, white structures immediately after contrast bolus is administered through a peripheral vein), but may become <b>more challenging in the late portal phase</b> (blood supply from arteries reaches the liver and from there goes back into the venous system through the portal vein) and delayed venous phases (most contrast washes out from the tissue and is filtered through the kidneys).<br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "| ![picture](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Kw47_0GUdvFwPjvjcGW588SGMXuV9TpF)      | ![picture](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1w288Lda5tI6_4sy3sFepgGX4HB0YYm-z)                                                                                         |\n",
    "|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n",
    "| Patient without contrast-enhancement and with a mass in the right upper lobe<br>(red circle) | Patient with contrast enhancement (upper red circle); <br>both the major chambers/arteries of the heart as well as the aorta (arrow) <br>appear as hyperdense white structures |\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Problem</b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually information about the contrast is <b>not included in the DICOM tags</b>, and manual assesment of the CT for the purpose of the data curation can take considerable time. In this task, we are adressing this problem by using radiomics of the GTV to classify the images. The ground truth labelling was performed by a radiology expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Notebook structure</b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script will take you through the radiomics analysis steps where you'll learn how to read in the features, select the features, train the models and display the results:\n",
    " - installing packages and importing libraries,  \n",
    " - preparation of the imaging data,\n",
    " - features extraction,\n",
    " - reading the data and assigning outcomes,\n",
    " - exploring the data,\n",
    " - removing highly correlated features,\n",
    " - selecting features using recursive feature elimination,\n",
    " - creating the classification models, displaying the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interactive Python notebook. To run it, you don't need to install anything on your PC since the script is executed in the cloud. On the left tab, you can see the 'Files' folder, that contains the data. Results of the script execution will be saved in this folder.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The dataset is open-source, so you can download the data to have a look at it. It you don't have any software to open DICOM files, you can download and install 3D Slicer (https://www.slicer.org/), RadiAnt viewer (https://www.radiantviewer.com/), or MicroDicom viewer (https://www.microdicom.com/downloads.html). As feature extraction process takes time, we prepared the .csv tables with the pre-extracted features to work with. They are available at the same shared folder. All the data will be pulled from the shared Google Drive to the temporary environment of this notebook. Further it is explained how to get these data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that all the files you pull or upload to this notebook, as well as the files, produced while executing the script, are automatically deleted as soon as you end the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the needed Python packages have to be uploaded. Some of them are not installed in the environment of this notebook, so the installation is needed with '!pip install <i>name-of-the-package</i>' command. We recommend you get acquainted with getting documentation and help on these packages. For example, google 'python sklearn' and you will get to the documentation quickly. Importing libraries is a necessary step with most progamming languages, not only Python."
